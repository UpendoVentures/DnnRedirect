The 3 types it supports they are each in its own database table and being evaluated sequentially based on types (all Parameter Rules first, then all Referrer rules, and finally all Role Rules). This made it difficult to extend with new types or to manage and configure rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo we decided to start from scratch with a better architecture, and Redirect Toolkit was born. It has a generic interface for rules (so there's only one table with the possibility to prioritize rules of any kind). And in release 2.0 we added possibility for developers to write their own redirect types, operators or additional actions and hook them into Redirect Toolkit.\r\n\r\nAnd now we feel that instead of throwing DNN Redirect away we should give it for FREE to the community, promoting Redirect Toolkit and our other modules altogether.\r\nIf you need more, make sure to:\r\n\r\n1.
